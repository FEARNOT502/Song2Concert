# Venue lab — status after round 11

Artifact: https://claude.ai/artifact/GAJY8f6CQP3od9iFZ2c9nk

## Round 11 (done)
- Tokyo Dome: the 3B side's B blocks are the 1B side mirrored (the official map traces
  only their labels there); open walkway between the 1st floor's back and the balcony
  (rooms take a `walk` mask); balcony and 2nd-floor seats behind home restored (row
  extraction tolerance in td_gen.py) with the boxes behind home (`suites`); field wall
  up to the stands' front at the poles; the outfield's back wall up to the roof.
- SSA, Wembley regenerated with the straight-line pipeline; aisle half-steps are
  rectangles (standgen `aisles_out`).
- Inspire (lab only) rebuilt from exact section polygons: `pipeline/insp_build.py`
  (replaces insp_seats.py/insp_gen.py). Skybox terraces on the east, red 300s tunnels
  onto a 1.3 m front walkway, ribbon along the 300s' fronts and the boxes' front,
  drapes beside the stage, stage 5 m further out, steel temporary stairs when the
  100s fold away.
- KSPO DOME (lab only): `pipeline/kspo_build.py`, `src/o-kspo.js`; references in
  `refs/kspo` (official chart, Offmate plan, KCISA Sketchfab models). End stage with a
  T thrust, drapes, the 1st floor's telescopic rows (B, D) as the toggle; A's are
  folded under the stage.
- `pipeline/bowlkit.py`: stairs finder shared by the exact-plane bowls.

## Branches
- `claude/elegant-knuth-r81twm`: everything, lab-only venues included.
- `main`: the app and the lab without the Inspire/KSPO sources (the lab builds and
  hides their tabs when their files are absent).

## Next ideas
- KSPO: the 2nd floor's back corridor doors, 1st-floor wheelchair platform details.
- Re-run reach tests after any pipeline change: `node reachtest.mjs <venue> <x,z>`,
  then `python3 reachcheck.py <venue> pipeline/<x>_stands.json <offset z>`.
